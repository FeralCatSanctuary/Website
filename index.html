    <p><i>Moss Landing, CA, located on the coast between Santa Cruz and Monterey, is a quaint 
agricultural and fishing village (officially an "unincorporated area") in Monterey County.
<br>
The peace and quiet has tempted many people to abandon their unwanted pets for decades.
</p>
<p>
Local Animal shelters and services have moved to a "hands-off" approach to feral cats.  

Which means thousands of animals are spared unnecessary euthanasia, but the communities 

they inhabit are left to find solutions.
</p>

<p>
Sally Slichter has supported the Moss Landing Heights feral cats, a colony of about 50, 

for over 20 years.  The costs of food, veterinary care and medication, spays & neuters 

total around $1,000 per month.</i>
